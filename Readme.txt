This python script takes large amounts of data of donors (starting donation date, ending donation date, donation amount etc.) 
and outputs the donors to the user categorically. 

Using for loops and mathematical functions, the script calculates the average length of the donor, average donation amount and their lifetime value.
It also analyzes the amount of money that came in through two different sources, and uses many iterative loops and conditionals to place 
them into the desired categories (Phone donors and Website donors).

The script is efficient and capable of analyzing more than 70,000 rows of data with 6 different columns totaling 420,000 entries of 
data in roughly 2.1 seconds.
